    "Due to the rapid industrial development, air pollution has become a big concern recently. Developed cities such as Beijing suffer from this difficulty. The major air pollutants PM2.5 are tiny particles in the air that are carcinogenic and will cause respiratory disease. In order to explore the pattern of Beijing PM2.5 concentration, this study will focus on the question: is PM2.5 concentration in Beijing seasonal? The Beijing PM2.5 Data Data Set will be used to answer this question. The dataset includes the daily data of PM2.5 concentration, temperature, dew points, pressure, wind conditions, and weather conditions in Beijing from 2010 to 2014. The variable characteristics are either integers or real numbers.\n"
